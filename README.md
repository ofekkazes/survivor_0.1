# survivor_0.1

This is a game I have been working on from Jul-18, learning LibGdx as I go. <br />
It is mainly about the aftermath of a nuclear war, the world is filled with zombies and nuclear waste. <br />
You, the player will need to gather resources, men and territories to become a civilization once again.

If you have any suggestions about the direction the game is going, please comment or send me an email at ofekkazes2@gmail.com.<br />
